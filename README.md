# WowViewer
I did that a million years ago, and since I don't have a lot of c++ on my github I decided to refresh it a bit and put it here.  
Need wow installed (tested with 9.2.7.45114).  
Requires https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/CascLib, I included the compiled libs but I probably shouldn't

## Supported/not supported
Its really not feature complete. I just did that for fun, and updated it enough to be shown on here, but won't work further on it.
- anim in m2 supported
- textures
- animated colors/transparency
- use custom shaders (don't use the ones in the game)
- no particles/ribbons
